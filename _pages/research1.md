##### **1. Unraveling Exotic Magnetic Properties in Complex Transition Metal Compounds**

Our research focuses on the theoretical exploration of magnetic properties, spanning from the ground state and equilibrium state to excited states. We aim to provide an accurate and predictive framework for understanding complex magnetic interactions and dynamic behaviors in strongly correlated systems.

A key aspect of our work involves analyzing magnetic exchange mechanisms—including direct exchange, superexchange, double exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, and RKKY interaction—all of which are well known to be dictated by the specific geometry, possible exchange routes, and the orbital structure within a given compound. This analysis is performed using the state-of-the-art LKAG approach. We also investigate complex magnetic configurations, such as spin spirals and skyrmions, and examine their responses to external perturbations, including temperature, magnetic field, and pressure, with the help of effective spin Hamiltonians.

Additionally, we conduct spin dynamic simulations to study time-dependent spin-spin correlation functions, dynamic structural factors, spin-wave spectra, as well as specific excited magnetic processes induced by spin-polarized current, such as spin transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT).
