##### **2. Coupling of Multiple Degrees of Freedom in Strongly Correlated Systems**

In addition to spin, different degrees of freedom coexist in electrons, including charge and orbital, all of which can not only interact with each other but also couple with lattice vibrations. Effectively integrating these couplings into a single device remains a key challenge in the development of multifunctional materials, where physical properties can be manipulated by external magnetic fields, electric fields, or strain.

Our research focuses on the intriguing interplay among these degrees of freedom, including magnon-phonon coupling and magnetoelectric coupling, as well as the corresponding emerging physical phenomena, such as anomalous negative thermal expansion and unconventional superconductivity.
